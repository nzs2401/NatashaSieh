These are some projects that I have worked on!!!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michigan Robotics  <br>

Currently working at the Field Robotics Group (FRoG) Lab!!!

Undergraduate Research Project
- Developed GPU-accelerated side-scan sonar simulation for OceanSim, a physics-based underwater robot perception framework, leveraging NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Python,     PhysX, and custom GPU code with Warp kernels. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1naX7FVNVjrl2pK1C0ho7yqw9UuYxW7y8/view)
- Built beam pattern generation, echo modeling, and terrain-aware acoustic imaging pipeline with real-time performance.
- Simulated fan-shaped sonar beams and validating against real-world shipwreck data for sim-to-real accuracy.
- Engineered ROS-to-ROS2 bridge to enhance interoperability across underwater robot simulation environments.
- Creating procedural terrain generation pipeline with NVIDIA SDG Replicator, enabling randomized topographies.

Robotics 1

  Knee Project
  - I made a 3D model of a bending knee joint using a 3D printer to print out my design of a tibia and a femur. The base and side support of the model was a piece of laser cut wood. The servo, controlled by a potentiometer, creates the bending motion. The rubber tube ligaments are used to limit the range of motion.
  - Electronics included: servo motor, potentiometer, and Arduino Uno

  Hotwheel Carousel
  - Built, designed, and coded a rotating carousel used to transport hotwheel cars to different tracks powered by a brushless motor and other electronics.
  - Electronics included: stepper motor, potentiometer, Arduino Nano, and a Liquid-crystal display (LCD)

Robotics 3

  Propeller Design
  - Used Onshape to design the shape, size, and style of the propellers
  - 3D printed the results and kept improving the propellers

  ESC, ESP32, & BLDC Motor used to control my Gearbox design
  - Programmed ESP32 to display the speed of the BLDC motor
  - Created a HTML interface with a slider to control and view the speed of the BLDC motor and project it onto an ESP32.
